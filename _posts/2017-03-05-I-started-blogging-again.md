Hy, this is my new blog and my first post after a very long time, I started blogging in 2015 during my Student Industrial Workshop Experience Scheme (SIWES) which was part of my required courses while I was in 300 level. I created a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog as one of my project and ever since then, I only published twice on the platform (The day I created the blog and 31st December, 2016) ....too bad hun? It's not really my fault, I'm not the writing type, I find it difficult and stressful most times to pen down my thoughts.
 
However, I have decided to pick it up from where I stopped and make it better. I started by creating a portfolio to showcase my myself and projects I've worked on, I also designed a new blog using [Jack's'](http://www.jack003.com/) theme on [github](https://github.com).

Henceforth, I will be writing about about stuffs I've learnt while developing applications, I might focus mainly on web applications for now, since I'm learning datascience and machine learning, I will also be writing about the little things I know.

Now how do I intend to keep up with this and not drop it off like I did the first time.

P.S: Its not like there are no stuffs to write, but I'm just too lazy to write and I really want to work on this.

One way you can help me in achieving this is to initiate discussion on my post, this will help me keep up to it and learn more so I can write better.

Stay tuned...Till I write again! #Gracias.
